  tiny news demo
</h1>

A tiny news co demo built with Gatsby, React, Google Docs, and a lot off integrations.

## ðŸš€ Quick start

1.  **Clone this repo**

    ```shell
    git clone git@github.com:news-catalyst/tiny-news-demo.git
    ```

1.  **Install the things.**

    Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and run:

    ```shell
    cd tiny-news-demo/
    npm install
    ```

1.  **Start up on localhost.**

    ```shell
    gatsby develop
    ```

1. **View the site and admin.**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

    There is also a tinycms at `http://localhost:8000/tinycms`!

## Overview

Public-facing pages (like `http://localhost:8000`, `http://localhost:8000/articles/your-title-here`) are served by gatsby based on data in graphQL.

This data is mainly imported into graphQL from Google Drive. Other data, like text labels and navigation, comes from `gatsby-config.js`.

Metadata on articles, including social media settings and tags, is managed via the tinycms. This is really just a simple web form that loads and updates data directly in Google Drive via Google APIs. If you make changes either in Google Drive or in tinycms and are wondering why you can't see them in the web pages, you probably need to restart the server (`gatsby develop`) or republish the site (`gatsby build`). _More troubleshooting should probably be written about this aspect at a later date_.

## Configuration & Integration 

How we actually create, configure and publish each tinynewsco site is TBD - and will probably be the result of an interactive scripted setup process. However, there are several integration and configuration points regardless of setup implementation. This section describes how to create a custom tinynewsco site.

### Setup Google Docs Integration

Google Docs is the main source of content for a tinynewsco. This requires a top-level folder created in Docs in which any document can be published live to the site. That is, if you'd like to write drafts in Google Docs, you need ot make sure to do that in a different folder, then move the document when it's ready for publication.

We recommend the following setup in Google Docs:

<img src="/static/docs/google-docs-top-level.png" />

Use separate folders for publication-ready content and in-progress drafts. Here we're using "Ready" and "Drafts" but you can call these whatever you like. How you organize your drafts is also entirely up to you, as the tinynewsco publisyhing platform ignores anything outside your version of a "Ready" folder.

<img src="/static/docs/google-docs-ready.png" />

Things start to get interesting within the "Ready" folder. The folder structure you setup here will translate directly into a URL or site structure for your tinynewsco. In the above example, there are three folders and a document. These will be published as:

* articles: `/articles/`
* opinion: `/opinion/`
* blog: `/blog`
* Top Article: `/top-article/`

In other words, any folder becomes a directory in the URL, any document becomes a page. You can nest folders as much as you like, for example, `articles` can include topic-level subfolders. 

More on this later, though. Now that you've created a `Ready` (or whatever you'd like to name this) folder in Google, make note of its folder ID:

<img src="/static/docs/google-docs-folder-id.png" />

Click into your `Ready` folder and copy the last bit of the URL for the folder ID, as shown in the above screenshot.

Now open `gatsby-config.js` in the top-level of this repo and find the configuration section for `gatsby-source-google-docs`. Update the `folders` array so your folder ID is included, like below:

```
     {
        resolve: "gatsby-source-google-docs",
        options: {
            folders: ["1lcfhd58_0D6-uP0Dwb0a_-Yri2L0h-6K"],
            debug: true,
        }
      },
```
